# Call Recorder Add-on

This add-on allows the main app ([Call Recorder - SKVALEX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.skvalex.cr)) to use advanced root features, such as:
- Record both sides (including Android 9 Pie)
- Start recording when a call get actually answered

It's not the app itself, you still need to install the main app.

## How to use it
After successful installation of this add-on, you'll see a new `ROOT` recording method and option `Start recording on answer` in `Settings` → `Recording` of the main app. Also, a star `★` will be shown prior audio source name selected in `Settings` → `Recording` → `Standard API`.

It's recommended to keep using Standard API recording method with `★ Voice call uplink + download` audio source. In case it doesn't work for you as expected, try luck with `ROOT` recording method.
