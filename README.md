# Call Recorder - SKVALEX
Call recording app to record both sides from the line with a power of root and magisk.

This module allows the app ([Call Recorder - SKVALEX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.skvalex.cr)) to use advanced root features, such as:
- Record both sides (including Android 9 Pie)
- Start recording when a call get actually answered

If you already have installed the main app, install this module to get advanced features. If not, this module will install the app for you.

## How to use it
After successful installation of this magisk module, you'll see a new `ROOT` recording method and option `Start recording on answer` in `Settings` → `Recording` of the main app. Also, a star `★` will be shown prior audio source name selected in `Settings` → `Recording` → `Standard API`.

It's recommended to keep using Standard API recording method with `★ Voice call uplink + downlink` audio source. In case it doesn't work for you as expected, try luck with `ROOT` recording method.
